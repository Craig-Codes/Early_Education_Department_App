# Early Education Department App
## Python console app to be used by primary school children - University Assessment

This app was created for a university assessment (please see artefact document for specification, essay and testing). The aim was to create a prototype application to be used by primary school children  to help with their schooling.

The app is a simple easy to use console app. The main.py file is the entry into the app, containing the menu system. The menu imports feature modules when required.

The app's feature modules include:
  * Calculator - Able to conduct addition, subraction, multiplication and division. Also able to store and recall input data in memory and add / subtract from memory.
  * Difficult word checker - Student inputs a sentence and the checker looks for certain words and changes them to the correct version, in this case changing the word 'structure' to 'building'.
  * Hangman - A hangman game giving the student five attempts to guess a five letter word.
  * Higher or Lower - A higher or lower game against the computer, first with three correct guesses in a row wins.
  * Notes - Notes storage feature, allowing users to create, read, update or delete notes.
  * Quiz - An educational quiz allowng students to pick a topic and complete a 5 question quiz, with the questions drawn randomly from the question bank.
  * Schedule - A daily schedule taking in data input by a teacher. Students can view their schedule, or edit it if required.
  
This prototype app allowed me to practice the fundamentals of the Python language, focusing on creating clean modular code. I was able to further develop my Object Orientate Programming principles, whilst focusing on data structures.
